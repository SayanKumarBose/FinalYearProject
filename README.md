# FinalYearProject
The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. In this paper different machine learning algorithms and deep learning are applied to compare the results and analysis of the UCI Machine Learning Heart Disease dataset.

The dataset consists of 14 main attributes used for performing the analysis. Various promising results are achieved and are validated using accuracy and confusion matrix. The datas are also normalized for getting better results.

Although many researches has been done to predict the cause of heart disease. We have a tried to built a heart disease detection system using python . The basic goal of this project is detect whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not. 
We have created an user interface to capture patient data and predict whether the patient is suffering from heart disease.
